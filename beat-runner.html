            <!-- The Challenge -->
            <div class="content-section">
                <h2 class="content-title">The Challenge</h2>
                <p class="content-text">
                    Design a rhythm game that feels great to play, works with any music, and includes full progression 
                    and monetization systems—all while being technically feasible as a web-based 3D experience.
                </p>
                <p class="content-text">
                    Most rhythm games rely on pre-charted content, which limits music selection and requires significant 
                    manual work. I wanted to create something that could <strong>adapt to any song automatically</strong> 
                    while maintaining tight, satisfying gameplay.
                </p>

                <h2 class="content-title">My Role & Design Approach</h2>
                <p class="content-text">
                    As the sole designer and developer, I handled everything from initial concept to final implementation:
                </p>
                <ul class="content-list">
                    <li><strong>Core Loop Design:</strong> Defined lane-based movement, rhythm timing windows, and obstacle variety</li>
                    <li><strong>Progression System:</strong> Created 30-level structure with difficulty curve and star-based unlocks</li>
                    <li><strong>Economy Design:</strong> Designed Orbs (soft currency) earning rate and cosmetic pricing</li>
                    <li><strong>Technical Implementation:</strong> Built the game in Three.js with BPM detection and sync</li>
                    <li><strong>UI/UX:</strong> Designed clean, game-feel focused interface with neon aesthetic</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <!-- Key Design Decisions -->
            <div class="content-section">
                <h2 class="content-title">Key Design Decisions</h2>
                
                <div class="design-decision">
                    <h3 class="decision-title">1. Three Lanes, Not Five</h3>
                    <p class="content-text">
                        <strong>Initial Design:</strong> Started with 5 lanes to maximize variety and challenge.
                    </p>
                    <p class="content-text">
                        <strong>Problem Discovered:</strong> Playtesters struggled with peripheral vision and made frequent 
                        input errors. The game felt chaotic rather than challenging.
                    </p>
                    <p class="content-text">
                        <strong>Solution:</strong> Reduced to 3 lanes. This simplified visual tracking while still allowing 
                        for interesting obstacle patterns. Added vertical variation (obstacles at different heights) to 
                        maintain complexity without overwhelming players.
                    </p>
                    <p class="content-text">
                        <strong>Result:</strong> Much better player feedback. The game felt "tight" and responsive rather than unfair.
                    </p>
                </div>

                <div class="design-decision">
                    <h3 class="decision-title">2. Visual Beat Indicators</h3>
                    <p class="content-text">
                        <strong>Problem:</strong> Players without strong rhythm sense struggled to time their movements, 
                        especially when learning new songs.
                    </p>
                    <p class="content-text">
                        <strong>Solution:</strong> Added pulsing lane highlights that flash on the beat. This gives players 
                        a visual cue to sync with the music without dictating exact actions.
                    </p>
                    <p class="content-text">
                        <strong>Design Principle:</strong> Help players succeed without removing the challenge. The indicators 
                        show <em>when</em> to act, but players still choose <em>what</em> to do.
                    </p>
                </div>

                <div class="design-decision">
                    <h3 class="decision-title">3. Two Game Modes for Different Player Mindsets</h3>
                    <p class="content-text">
                        <strong>Stage Mode:</strong> 30 handcrafted levels with specific difficulty curves, star ratings, 
                        and unlock progression. Appeals to achievement-oriented players who want clear goals.
                    </p>
                    <p class="content-text">
                        <strong>Free Run Mode:</strong> Upload any song and play infinitely. Appeals to players who want 
                        to zone out with their own music. No pressure, pure flow state.
                    </p>
                    <p class="content-text">
                        <strong>Why Both Matter:</strong> Different sessions call for different experiences. After a stressful 
                        day, players want Free Run. When they want to improve, they pick Stage Mode.
                    </p>
                </div>

                <div class="design-decision">
                    <h3 class="decision-title">4. Orbs as Engagement, Not Monetization Blocker</h3>
                    <p class="content-text">
                        <strong>Economy Design:</strong> Orbs (soft currency) are earned generously through gameplay. 
                        Players collect them by hitting obstacles perfectly.
                    </p>
                    <p class="content-text">
                        <strong>Cosmetic Shop:</strong> Two ball skins available (Disco Ball, Fire Ball). Prices are 
                        achievable within 3-5 runs, ensuring players can unlock content through play.
                    </p>
                    <p class="content-text">
                        <strong>Design Philosophy:</strong> The shop exists to give players goals and variety, not to 
                        frustrate them. In a real F2P implementation, I'd add premium currency for faster unlocks, 
                        but the core experience remains free.

                        Early levels were too hard. Players quit before experiencing the "flow state" that makes rhythm
